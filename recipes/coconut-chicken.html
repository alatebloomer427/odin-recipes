        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion - diced</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic - minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon fresh ginger - grated</li>
            <li>1 serrano chili pepper - or jalapeño, diced (optional)</li>
            <li>1.5 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>0.25 cup fresh lime juice - plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon fresh cilantro - to garnish</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes - to garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice each chicken breast in half lengthwise to make four thinner chicken breast cutlets. Season both sides with salt, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.</li>
            <li>Melt the coconut oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken and sear for approximately 3-5 minutes on each side, or until golden and nearly cooked through. Remove chicken and transfer to a clean plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet over medium heat, add one more tablespoon of coconut oil. Add the onions and sauté for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently. Once the onions have softened, add the garlic, ginger, and diced chili pepper (if using). Mix well and continue to cook for one minute more, stirring continuously.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low. Stir in the fresh lime juice, brown sugar, and soy sauce. Mix well to combine.</li>
            <li>Allow the mixture to simmer and reduce for approximately 5 minutes, then add the coconut cream.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken back to the skillet. Cover and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and heated through.</li>
            <li>Serve garnished with chopped cilantro, red chili flakes, and fresh lime juice.</li>
        </ol>
